# Realtime Colors Application Clone Documentation

## 1. Introduction

The Realtime Colors Application Clone is a web-based platform that empowers users to explore, visualize, and finalize their color choices. Whether for text, background, primary, secondary, or accent colors, users can experiment and customize their color scheme. The application also supports randomization of colors, allowing users to lock preferred colors and then randomize the remaining ones. The dark and light mode color options provide further flexibility. Exporting color choices is made easy with various format options, including CSS, SCSS, tailwind CSS, images, and CSV. Users can even generate a shareable link to apply saved color choices.
